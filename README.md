## üöÄ What is this?

**Multi-Bot Discord Spammer** is a Python tool that lets you control a fleet of Discord bots to:

- Spam DMs to a user
- Spam mention tags in a channel
- Showcase (for demonstration) the base64-encoded user ID as a token stub
- All via easy commands in Discord, with neat black-embedded responses

Perfect for stress-testing your own server or, you know, showing your friends how NOT to piss you off.  
(But seriously, use responsibly.)

## üíª Features

- **Multi-token support:** Run a whole army of bots from one script
- **Whitelist:** Only you (or specified user IDs) can run commands
- **Black-themed embeds:** All response messages look clean and pro
- **No-nonsense UI:** No clutter, no noise, just the commands you want
- **Single-bot help:** Only one bot responds to `a!help`/`a!commands` so you don't get flooded
